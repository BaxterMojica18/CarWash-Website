# Dashboard & Products Updates

## 1. Product/Service ID Tracking

### New Columns Added
Added to `products_services` table:
- `product_id` VARCHAR - Format: "PROD-000001", "PROD-000002", etc.
- `service_id` VARCHAR - Format: "SERV-000001", "SERV-000002", etc.

### Auto-Generation
- When creating a product (type='product'), `product_id` is auto-generated
- When creating a service (type='service'), `service_id` is auto-generated
- Format: Type prefix + 6-digit zero-padded ID

### Migration Required
Run this command to add columns and generate IDs for existing records:
```bash
python add_product_service_ids.py
```

### Benefits
- Better tracking and identification
- Easier to reference in reports
- Professional ID format
- Separate numbering for products vs services
