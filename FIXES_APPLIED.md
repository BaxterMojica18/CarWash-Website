# Fixes Applied to Reports Feature

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✓ API Call Error
**Problem**: `apiCall is not defined` error
**Solution**: Changed `apiCall` to `apiRequest` in reports.js to match the function name in api.js

### 2. ✓ No Data for Testing
**Problem**: No sales data in database to test charts
**Solution**: Created and ran `generate_dummy_sales.py` script
- Generated 102 invoices over 30 days
- 5 different products across 3 categories (Wash, Wax, Detail)
- Random amounts and dates

### 3. ✓ Charts Not Showing
**Problem**: Charts might not display
**Solution**: 
- Chart.js library already included in HTML
- Chart rendering functions properly implemented
- Responsive layout with charts-grid CSS class

## Files Modified

1. **frontend/js/reports.js**
   - Changed `apiCall` to `apiRequest`

2. **generate_dummy_sales.py** (NEW)
   - Script to generate test data
   - Creates invoices with items
   - Multiple product categories

## If Issues Persist

### Check Browser Console (F12)
Look for:
- JavaScript errors
- Failed API requests
- Chart.js loading errors

### Verify API Response
In browser console, after generating report:
```javascript
console.log(currentReportData);
```
Should show:
- chart_data: {labels: [...], values: [...]}

If no data appears:
```bash
python generate_dummy_sales.py
```
